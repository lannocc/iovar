saw_112016_4 - Moved win.iovar.web.proc.Job to win.iovar.web.lib package.

saw_112016_3 - Package com.iovar renamed to win.iovar to reflect domain changes. Bumped version
               string to 1.0 since that's the version we're working towards (a 1.0-alpha branch
               has been created for the previous changeset in case fixes need to get applied for
               production services that are using the alpha version.

saw_111916_1 - Moved etc/web.xml to etc/sample.web.xml. Was working on debugging form submission
               pass-through issue but this debugging has been commented out for the moment.

saw_111616_1 - Add support for ${#1}, ${#2}, ... to get the length of the anonymous arguments. MySql
               device now actually returns proper column labels to allow "SELECT COUNT(*) AS X" in
               list queries. Add a handlerHref() utility method to Transport that allows a query
               embedded in the path (required for backwards compatibility with Thompson project).
               /bin/test now internally uses BigInteger for numerical tests, allowing for very large
               integer comparisons.

               Interactive mode stylesheet path updated to new /usr/include/iovar location.

saw_110216_1 - A fix to frame.js.

               a colon-separated list of relative path names to exclude.

			   Add '?variables' option to XSLT.

saw_102916_1 - Add a simple Application.java that turns on auto-exec support (you'll have to add
               it to web.xml and map it for a directory e.g. /app).

saw_102716_1 - WebBuilder ant task and MySql device now support configs for
               multiple databases beneath /dev/mysql. ShellSession gets
			   setUser() and getUser(). Improvements to xmlget, xmlin, and
			   xmlset. XSLT TransportResolver now handles embedded
			   data:text/xml content-type. More changes for auto-exec.

saw_092716_1 - Pull in xmlset, xmlget, and xmlwrap commands from [W].

saw_092116_1 - First commit for Virgo Venture, changes include:
				- /bin/redirect displays usable output when VIEW=text.
				- /bin/system now better handles processes that output lots of data.
				- /dev/trans/https added for https transport support.
				- /dev/trans/file now looks for index file on POST to directory,
                                  checks execute bit.
				- /bin/test gets new test to check if input string is given type
                                  (integer, for now).
				- Add an auto-exec mode to the Default servlet handler.

saw_100115_1 - Add direct command-line syntax support to the shell alias (e.g.: /$?=echo+hello).

saw_092215_1 - #6: Some work on remote session handling. Very poor support at the moment.

saw_092115_2 - Fix to ShellSession... don't store actual Instance in HttpSession. In order to
               minimize stale instances floating around we now just store the ID instead.

saw_092115_1 - Interactive servlet now supports an XML+XSL mode via 'style' property defined in
               /etc/interactive.conf and also updates HISTORY variable.

saw_091915_1 - Misc. fixes and enhancements. Added the (temporary) ?preproc option to xslt. Simple
               built-in support for canonicalized/keyword URLs aka canon.

saw_080315_1 - Add missing files for creating new codetable entries.

saw_072415_1 - #6: Improving the way sessions are handled when calling scripts.

saw_071315_2 - #5: Fix to default handler for references to directories.
               
               Make "app.jars" the default target in build.xml.

saw_071315_1 - #2: Fixes to Resource for handling JAR-packaged files.

saw_071115_1 - #2: Moved the default local file/resource handler servlet
               (com.iovar.web.dev.trans.Local$Servlet) to com.iovar.web.Default.

saw_070815_1 - Splitting off iovar-demo as a separate repository.

saw_070715_1 - Update copyright year in LICENSE file.

saw_062015_2 - Some significant reorganization in the interest of making it easier to secure sites
               deployed with IOVAR. The /usr directory now only contains resources accessible to
               end-users directly:
                - /usr/bin moved to /bin
                - /usr/sbin moved to /sbin
                - views (/usr/xhtml, /usr/xml, etc.) have been moved to /srv

saw_020315_1 - Much work on ShellSession to properly handle user sessions.

saw_013115_1 - Add /proc/meminfo, /proc/uptime, /usr/bin/uptime, and /sbin/debug. Modify
               /proc/shell to return session count when referenced as /proc/shell/.

saw_012915_1 - Create TaskData class for encapsulating the data necessary for task execution,
               thereby simplifying numerous method signatures.

                - User support.
                - Rewritten Call exec with improved variable handling.
                - Pass-through for content-disposition.

                - /bin/cat support for setting content-disposition.
                - /bin/echo gets ?noline option.
                - MySQL device improvements, including: bulk update (POST); multi-table delete;
                  ?join, ?group, and ?limit options.
                - /usr/bin/formfile gets ?quiet option; ?export renamed to ?set.
                - /usr/bin/sed now requires the "g" option since it currently only operates as a
                  global substitution.
                - /usr/bin/xlink gets ?quiet option and also allows embedding non-XML resources.
                - /usr/bin/xmlout now escapes tag names, adds "tag-name-orig" attribute.
                - Add /usr/bin/xmlin (also /bin/xi).
                - /usr/bin/xslt passes in extra anonymous arguments as arg1, arg2,... parameters.

                - /bin/export and /bin/set now accept a value from standard input.
                - /$ execution now ignores ?iosession parameter (needs redesign).
                - Add ?first option to /bin/cat to display command-line resources before standard
                  input.
                - /bin/delete and /bin/put now pass-through any arguments.
                - /bin/echo now prints literal newline instead of system default.

                - MySQL device improvements.
                - /usr/bin/form2xml now handles multipart/form-data.
                - Add daily and specific-time modes to /usr/sbin/cron.
                - Add a version of pipe() to Utils that stops when a specified sequence is found.

saw_061014_1 - Many improvements:
                - /usr/bin/sed (simple stream editor), uses Java's String.replaceAll ().
                - /usr/bin/java2xml and /usr/bin/xml2java (dependency on XStream).
                - /sbin/cron for simple command scheduling.
                - Shell session instance management slightly improved and added concept of a
                  'master' session.
                - New (optional) init system and implementation via Init servlet (/sbin/init),
                  init configuration at /etc/inittab, and scripts at /etc/rc and /etc/environment.
                - Add support for 'iovar.sessions', 'iovar.log.level', and 'iovar.log.file'
                  context parameters.
                - Log and Init servlets are specified explicitly in web.xml to ensure load on
                  startup.
                - WebBuilder Ant task adds optional support for a starting <load-on-startup> value
                  that all automatic servlet entries can be given incrementally.
                - Http transport now supports PATCH method (dependency on Apache httpclient).
                - Better handling and pass-through of content-type (still not complete).
                - Misc. bug fixes.

saw_050914_1 - /bin/help.

saw_050814_10 - Transport handlers now extend HttpServlet and behave as shell utilities. This
                allows pluggable handlers to work when WAR-packaged and lacking the original
                symlinks.

saw_050814_9 - Clean out more old files.

saw_050814_8 - Updated INSTALL file for Google Code.

saw_050814_7 - Minor INSTALL / README file updates.

saw_050814_6 - Add LICENSE (MIT). Add sample.project.xml for Netbeans.

saw_050814_5 - Add sample.build.properties and sample.app.properties.

saw_050814_4 - Add /bin/iosh as another link to the IOVAR shell. Scripts that cannot or should not
               be used in BASH now reference /bin/iosh instead of /bin/sh (or /bin/bash, etc.).

saw_050814_3 - Preparing for beta release: removing old and extra stuff.

saw_050814_2 - More build.xml fixes.

saw_050814_1 - Cleaning up build.xml. Ant 'project' task now builds a WAR (deployment not tested).

saw_042714_2 - XML Copy now adds prefix mappings as necessary.

saw_042714_1 - /usr/bin/xlink.

saw_042514_1 - /dev/buffer.

saw_042414_6 - Simply /dev/null.

saw_042414_5 - /bin/system will now pass other named parameters as environment variables.

saw_042414_4 - Escaped shell graph item now properly handles \n, \r, and \t. /bin/system now
               passes input to the system process.

saw_042414_3 - Shell parameter handling (?x=y) now properly handles multiple assignments for the
               same parameter name.

saw_042414_2 - MySql ?follow support for getList also.

saw_042414_1 - Add ?follow parameter to MySql driver for following selected columns.

saw_042114_13 - Add ?where and ?order parameters to MySql driver when retrieving a list.
                /usr/bin/xmlout now (roughly) handles any input passed in and inserts the new
                node(s) in the top of the document.

saw_042114_12 - Links aren't properly handled when they're pointing to folders (need to work it out
                later).

saw_042114_11 - The beginnings of proper redirect handling (no longer do we allow HttpURLConnection
                to follow them automatically). Right now only Call actually properly follows a
                redirect on invocation.

saw_042114_10 - /bin/system now looks for colon in command arguments and interprets as a local
                transport handler (still very hacky).

saw_042114_9 - Fix problem when variable assignment is the only command in an operation.

saw_042114_8 - /bin/system should send process error stream to stdout.

saw_042114_7 - /bin/sh should only try processing POST data if no anonymous args passed in.

saw_042114_6 - /bin/sh will now process POST data as though it were a shell script.

saw_042114_5 - MySql driver now supports DELETE.

saw_042114_4 - MySql driver needs to quote column names when doing insert.

saw_042114_3 - MySql driver now does insert in PUT / (instead of POST).

saw_042114_2 - Make sure table name is quoted when getting description in MySql driver.

saw_042114_1 - MySql driver now differentiates between request for directory listing (ending with
               slash) and request for new item template (no slash).

saw_041914_7 - Fix problem of Background ('&') gobbling up '&&'.

saw_041914_6 - /bin/sleep.

saw_041914_5 - Basic job control.

saw_041914_4 - /bin/system - execute system call. Add file: transport support.

saw_041914_3 - MySql driver and /usr/bin/form2xml now add "tag-name-orig" attribute if the tag
               name had to be modified to follow XML spec.

saw_041914_2 - Some basic column name sanitation for XML tag name in MySql driver.

saw_041914_1 - Remove the "iolink" init-parameter hack; use getServletPath () instead.

saw_041714_8 - /usr/bin/form2xml - converts standard input URLEncoded data into simple xml tree.

saw_041714_7 - /usr/bin/get now passes along any parameters. MySql and PostreSQL drivers will now
               fetch an optional list of columns when requesting a list.

saw_041714_6 - /usr/bin/xslt now passes named parameters to stylesheets. Created /usr/bin/setxsl
               for easily adding <?xsl-stylesheet?> instructions to XMl documents.

               Scripts can now utilize standard input (passed automatically to the first
               operation).

saw_041714_5 - Make sure session gets persisted when variable assignment happens.

saw_041714_4 - Variable assignments as part of an operation work again (instead of only via the
               export command).

saw_041714_3 - Default session handler should also execute /etc/shrc.

saw_041714_2 - Now supporting GET requests to $/* as a convenience mechanism to POST to * and
               utilize a default session.

saw_041714_1 - /usr/bin/xargs, currently handling application/x-www-form-urlencoded input.

saw_041614_1 - Added Parameter type. Http transport and task Return struct now handle content-type.
               /bin/cat is the first to support named parameters with ?help and ?type= options.

saw_041514_3 - Basic implementations for mkdir, rm, rmdir, touch.

saw_041514_2 - Improve the interactive interface.

saw_041514_1 - GraphReader now supports multiple read-ahead (peek at many). Conditional tests have
               been moved out of Operation and into Group where they belong, greatly simplifying
               and improving logic and nested block handling.
               
               Still some work to do with status code propagation in certain spots where it should
